CodeBayArea kicked off its first class at the Vineyard Library this last Saturday, September 10th.

Our class took place in the Community Room, which was not in plain sight so Kevin had to greet the parents and students.

But after that, it was mostly smoothing sailing. After Cameron [helped the students](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2491.JPG) get the Internet set up, the class was ready to begin. Cameron gave a presentation about Python and giving examples of its usage in the real world.

To follow, Cameron and Kylee helped the students download the pre-requisites to interact with Python.

And now Cameron was able to [teach the class the basics of Python](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2510.JPG). The projected screen wasn't very visible so we made a [color scheme](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2520.JPG) change from a white background to a blue one within the Python IDLE integrated development environment (sorry for the inconvenience for those sitting in the back).

Cameron covered two operators: `and` plus `or`, a fairly accessible topic. We affirmed that sloths are rad and that when presented with a scenario like `8-3==7 or 6+1==7`, Python would return a `True`.

Kylee then gave an example of a potential usage of those operators - in a school gradebook. How can we use operators to convert a numerical grade (e.g. 88) and convert it to a letter grade (an 88 would correspond to a B)? By writing `if` statements and utilizing operators!

Of course we didn't give out that "answer" beforehand, we had the students attempt the gradebook problem first. We could see our students trying to [work it out](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2539.JPG) as well as [celebrating](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2544.JPG) (oh, the joys of Python).

We took a sneak peak at next week's material dealing with graphics, and took a few class pictures.

See you all next week for another fruitful session!
