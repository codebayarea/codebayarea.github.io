CodeBayArea kicked off its first class at the Vineyard Library this last Saturday, September 10th.

Our class took place in the Community Room, which was not in plain sight so Kevin had to greet the parents and students.

But after that, it was mostly smoothing sailing. After Cameron [helped the students](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2491.JPG) get the Internet set up, the class was ready to begin.
