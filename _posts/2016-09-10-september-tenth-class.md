CodeBayArea kicked off its first class at the Vineyard Library this last Saturday, September 10th.

Our class took place in the Community Room, which was not in plain sight so Kevin had to greet the parents and students.

But after that, it was mostly smoothing sailing. After Cameron [helped the students](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2491.JPG) get the Internet set up, the class was ready to begin. Cameron gave a presentation about Python and giving examples of its usage in the real world.

To follow, Cameron and Kylee helped the students download the pre-requisites to interact with Python.

And now Cameron was able to [teach the class the basics of Python](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2510.JPG). The projected screen wasn't very visible so we made a [color scheme](/img/Python/09102016/DSCF2520.JPG) change within the Python IDLE integrated development environment (sorry for inconvenience for those sitting in the back).

Cameron covered two operators: `and` plus `or`, a fairly accessible topic. We affirmed that sloths are rad and that when presented with a scenario like `8-3==7 or 6+1==7`, Python would return a `True`.
