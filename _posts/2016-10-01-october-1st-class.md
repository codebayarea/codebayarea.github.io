These past four weeks passed by quickly: must all good things must come to an end? We believe that there's a small caveat.

But anyway, we continue this week by teaching more building blocks on programming in Python. These concepts are mainly logic based. A basic example would look something along the lines of: 

{% highlight python %}
num = int(input("give me a number to check: "))
check = int(input("give me a number to divide by: "))

if num % 4 == 0:
    print(num, "is a multiple of 4")
elif num % 2 == 0:
    print(num, "is an even number")
else:
    print(num, "is an odd number")

if num % check == 0:
    print(num, "divides evenly by", check)
else:
    print(num, "does not divide evenly by", check)
{% endhighlight %}


So in that above snippet of code, we can determine if a given number is divisible by four (definition of a multiple), and if it is even or not. It also determines whether the number is divisble into a whole number by a given divisor. This type of logic comes into use when we are programming games like Rock-paper-scissors, where for example, we compare two variables to determine wins and losses and ties.

After we understood the concepts behind a Rock-paper-scissors program, the class was ready for something more complicated, such as a number guessing game. Because of its difficulty, we had quite a bit of student collaboration going on!

But of course, teachers jump in to help out as well - it's what we're here for after all, right?

After lots of [hard work](/img/Python/10012016/DSCF2714.JPG) [and comprehending concepts](/img/Python/10012016/DSCF2714.JPG), we go through a possible solution on how this is number guessing can be programmed.

And this basically wraps up our last class, and our four-week Python course. But referring back to the starting sentence, even though our first introductory Python course has come to a closer, we have something new coming right up: a web-development course! If you enjoyed your Python course and have not yet satiated your interest in programming, we strongly encourage you to join us for that, to slither like a Python to a new language!
