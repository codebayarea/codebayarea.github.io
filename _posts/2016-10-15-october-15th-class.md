Here at CodeBayArea, we make things *nasty*.

Of course, when a chocolate chip cookie grilled cheese sandwich was suggested by nearly all of our students to be put on our prototype/sample site, we mean nasty in its typical definition: physically repulsive.

However, when it came to our students' websites, nasty is also an apt adjective, but no longer in the typical sense. Urban Dictionary has our back in this case:

> A word used to describes someone's excellent ability at something or to describe something that is ridiculously good.

So our students learned how to make the nastiest sites possible. We built off our new site from the site we worked on last class. We started by learning how to make lists, like [so](/img/Webdev/10152016/DSCF2843.JPG).

Student examples included a ["Baseball+Google!" page](/img/Webdev/10152016/DSCF2848.JPG) as well as a ["MASTER MOD"](/img/Webdev/10152016/DSCF2849.JPG) page - creative alternatives to Cameron's cheese page!

Up next, we were able to work more on organization. Last time, we were able to get images and YouTube videos embedded on our site, but they ended up a little disorganized. However, with the help of the `<center>` tag, we were able to get stuff more organized.

Now we get some delicious Mac and Cheese, aligned neatly, perfectly center on our web page.

Not only were we able to embed YouTube videos, but we were also able to get zesty games like Pac-Man and a [chatroom](/img/Webdev/10152016/DSCF2876.JPG) going on, all embedded in each student's site. Truly nasty!

And here are some other miscellaneous class pics that I didn't want to leave out:

Thanks again for coming, hardworking students!
