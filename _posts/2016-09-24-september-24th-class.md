We started off the class today with a review of some of the Python `turtle` that we used last week.

Even though this code was a little challenging, we muscled through it and managed to get it all working! 

We had an output that required functions, different colors, and some math in order to work. It looked like this when completed:

After conquering the complex turtle code, we were ready to move on to `functions`!

We wrote a couple functions together so that we had the basics down at first:

After getting more accustomed to functions, we even had some students come up and write some functions!
We modified some `math operators` and called the functions to calculate the numbers we gave it!

We even wrote a function to show how hungry we were at the time!
