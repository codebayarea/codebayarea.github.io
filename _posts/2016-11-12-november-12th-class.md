Based on what we have done this class, one may reasonably ask: "How is this related to web development?"

It'll take more than a week to explain why, but we'll be using some Javascript magic to enhance our websites. We thought it would be pretty cool to use a game like Pong to ease students into Javascript.

Even though programming a ball bouncing off of surfaces may seem pretty easy, this effort will likely be the longest project that students here have worked on. As a result, we were not able to deliver a complete product this class session. It is to be expected as this project contains more than two hundred lines of code in a new language.

And everyone digested the material really quickly given that this is a new language they are learning. As we were going around helping the students, almost all of the errors were syntactical issues, not logic related. We were really blown away by how smoothly class went - smart, smart kids.

We ended up class by making the pong paddles, but the ball was not able to move. This what we will be working (pong) next class!
