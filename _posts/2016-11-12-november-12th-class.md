Based on what we have done this class, one may reasonably ask: "How is this related to web development?"

It'll take more than a week to explain why, but we'll be using some Javascript magic to enhance our websites. We thought it would be pretty cool to use a game like Pong to ease students into Javascript.

Even though programming a ball bouncing off of surfaces may seem pretty easy, this initial impression is quite deceiving. We were not able to completely code Pong this class session. But don't be put down! This was to be expected as this project contains more than two hundred lines of code, all in a new language, likely the longest project that students here have worked on.

And everyone digested the material really quickly, especially given that this is a new language they are learning. As we were going around helping the students, almost all of the errors were syntactical issues, not logic related. We were really blown away by how smoothly class went - smart, smart kids.

We ended up class by making the pong paddles, but the ball was not able to move. This what we will be working pong^(haha get it) next class!
