In our last class of this introductory webdev course, we cemented the foundations that we set last class.

We begin by introducing available fonts. On different sites, we see different typefaces so we made this option available to students.

For example, if we wanted to use the Arial font, we would put this line in our CSS

{% highlight CSS %}
body {
    font-family: "Arial";
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now back to making a website - we're making a Bay Area themed Google!

Students are available to choose their themes of choice as well. We saw baseball and video game adorned websites, reflecting the students' interests in programming websites. Sites generally followed this layout:

Lastly, we wanted to emphasize that CodeBayArea alone most likely can't teach all aspects of web development. So, we shared resources such as Codecademy but also our emails because we know that online avenues of learning can be harder to navigate for younger learners.

We do have an intermediate web development on the horizon though, so sign up for that if you want some more CodeBayArea goodness!
