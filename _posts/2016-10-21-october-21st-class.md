This CodeBayArea coding session is quite out of the norm in terms of location, curriculum, and students, as CodeBayArea was able to collaborate with LinkedIn to run its annual KidsInCoding event!

The timing was extended as well from our typical two hour session. Our schedule was as follows:

> 9:30 - 10:00 — Check-in and breakfast

> 10:10 - 10:15 — Welcome address

> 10:15 - 11:15 — Coding Workshop

> 11:15 - 12:00 — Presentation: Pursuing the Computer Science Degree

> 12:00 - 1:00 — Lunch

> 1:00 - 2:00 — "Rock Your Profile" Workshop

> 2:00 - 2:45 — Employee Panel

> 2:45 - 3:00 — Break

> 3:00 - 3:15 — Intro to CodeBayArea and LinkedIn Learning

> 3:15 - 3:30 — Wrap up

For our hour long coding session, we decided to use Python and its `turtle` module to introduce our students to programming. We have used turtle before as seen in our [second](http://blog.codebayarea.com/2016/09/17/september-seventeenth-class.html) and [third](http://blog.codebayarea.com/2016/09/24/september-24th-class.html) sessions of our introductory Python courses.

However, given that our students in this session are older, the students were able to experiment more with the possibilities of `turtle`.

LinkedIn engineers were also here to help out each student in an one-on-one fashion, adjusting our given curriculum to tailor to each student's imagination.

We then had Keith Schwarz, a lecturer in Stanford's Computer Science department, give a presentation on the rapidly growing field of computer science and its many applicabilities, ranging from graphics to data science. Students were able to see the wide scope of computer science in our world today.

After lunch, we had a profile building session to help students create a LinkedIn profile, adding the facet of professionalism into their range of social media networks.

The Employee Panel was next, where current LinkedIn employees shared their paths to LinkedIn. We were able to see how non-traditional paths such as purusing art history could prove useful in the realm of technology, attesting to the breadth and synergy between computer science and seemingly unrelated fields.

Before wrapping up our day, we had a few students share what they learned:

Huge thanks to those at LinkedIn, students and teachers, and all others who helped turn KidsInCoding into a success!
