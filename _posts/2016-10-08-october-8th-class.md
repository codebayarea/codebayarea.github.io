Today was the first session out of three on introductory web development. It was great to see some familiar faces from our Python course, as well as newcomers!

We started class off by installing the [brackets](http://brackets.io/) text editor. Our first concept is in HTML, the backbone of a given website. We first learned about headers:

{% highlight HTML %}
<h1>This is a big header tag!</h1>
<h2>This is a h2 tag!</h2>
<h3>This is an h3 tag!</h3>
<h4>This is getting smaller.... H4 tag!</h4>
<h5>This is an h5 tag!</h5>
<h6>This is the smallest heading tag! H6!</h6>
<p>This is a paragraph!</p>
{% endhighlight %}

Basically, the header text gets smaller as the accompanying number increases.

We also learn how to bold text through `<b>` or `<strong>` and italisize through `<i></i>` and `<em>`. Highlighting is done through `<mark>`.

Ah, but what kind of website *only* has text? Pretty boring, right? Almost all websites today have images in them as well, so we got to learn how to embed images into our website next - time to spice things up.

After asking the class what image they would like to use, we heard quite a few shouts for Donald Trump, so that was the image we used to demonstrate how to have images on our [site](/img/Webdev/10082016/DSCF2755.JPG). Which, by the way, is done like so:

{% highlight HTML %}
<img src=“insert image link”>
{% endhighlight %}

We sometimes need to resize those images so we don't end up with things like [this](/img/Webdev/10082016/DSCF2764.JPG), so we can append things to that line above to do so:

{% highlight HTML %}
<img src=“insert image link” style:width=“_px” height=“_px”>
{% endhighlight %}

So now we have the bones of the website done. But where's the meat? That's where CSS comes in. In its current stage, the website has a standard white background, but through CSS, we were able to get something much snazzier.

We got many creative examples after - here is a student made one, featuring Nyan Cat.

It's actually not visible through a static image, but the background was moving as it was a gif. Cool, huh?

Through our [instructors' assistance](/img/Webdev/10082016/DSCF2782.JPG), we were able to get many cool first sites going. By the way, by the end of our three week session, we hope to get all students' creations hosted online so they can be exhibited to the entire World Wide Web.

Those were the many things that we were able to accomplish in our first class today. At this pace, we'll have some super cool things accomplished together by the end of the month!
