Currently, we have our ball and paddles present from our pong game last class, but they are unable to move. Now, our goal is to get those things to move.

We won't be doing that this class though. After a class referendum, we decided that we would be working on a fishtank program instead as we were too ambitious with our pong game - students were a bit confused with what they were writing, so we will be finishing that next class. The fishtank is an easier program which is easier to understand, and so Kylie started teaching it.

And so we got going! Because we had such a difficult experience earlier with the pong game, coding fish tank was in comparison much easier.

This was Kylie's example of a fishtank:

However, as always, our students are able to diverge from our prototypes which is great! An example is seen below:

Look at how colorful and populated it is! Very cool to see new directions being taken with the fish tank project. There are no bounds to students' creativity (except when imposed by hardware - the computer started lagging because there were so many fish).

Next week, we hope to use our gained knowledge from this session to finish tackling the pong game. Have a great Thanksgiving, and see you all by then!
